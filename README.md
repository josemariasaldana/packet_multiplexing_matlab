This Matlab code is for simulating the multiplexing (aggregation) of packets. You can aggregate VoIP packets, and also packets of different First Person Shooter video games. You can add background traffic.

You can execute "bucle_multiplexar_games_vX". It runs a series of tests, using the next variables:

- different values of period and timeout
- different number of players

## Note
I did these simulations a long time ago. Currently my university does not pay for the Matlab license. Therefore, I cannot even open the files. So I cannot give any support.
